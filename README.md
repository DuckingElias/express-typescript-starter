# Express Typescript Starter
A small starter/boilerplate for a TypeScript-Express application.

 1. Clone Repository
 2. Make sure that you have [NodeJS, NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) installed.
 3. Install all dependencies using `npm install`
 4. You will need certificates, so that HTTPS will work. You can place your own *cert.key* and *cert.crt* files, or you can use `npm run certificate` to generate localhost-certificates. (Requires OpenSLL installed)
 5. You can build the application using `npm run build` and then launch it using `npm run start` (Or just do both with `npm run dev`)
